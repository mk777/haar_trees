    <div class="description">
      An experimental project to explore the use of tree-based representation of 
      Haar wavelet coefficients for a time series.
    </div>

    <h2>Project description</h2>
      <h3>Motivation</h3>
      <p>
	I have had the idea of using a structured numerical representation of a two-dimensional 
	graph of a function, such as a time series, for some time now. When I decided to 
	try out OCaml, this project looked like the right testing ground. Naturally, the code is 
	amaturish, but the project gave me a chance to explore several language features in a fairly 
	realistic setting, so I think it was quite useful overall.
      </p>
      <p>
	When computing the 
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haar_wavelet"> Haar wavelet</a> 
	coeffficients, one essentially runs a recursive procedure,
	where each step consists of 
	<ul>
	  <li>computing the differences between the average values of a
	  function on the left and the right halfs of an interval for a set of intevals,
	  </li> 
	  <li> storing the differences </li>
	  <li> bisecting the original intervals before passing them as input to a 
	  recursive call.
	  </li>
	</ul>
	  So, fundamentally, the Haar wavelet coefficients are not just a set of numbers,
	but could be seen as the values at the nodes of a binary tree. While not terribly useful 
	by itself, this observation suggests a representation of the graph of the function which
	has enough structure to allow for a quick assesment of the overall shape, perhaps similar 
	to the one a reasonably educated human being would make upon being shown a graph of a function.
	This tree immediately shows if the function has a general trend, how volatile it is on a variety of scales, 
	what is the overall dynamics as the argument varies from left to right along the x-axis, etc. 
	Even more importanly, it might eventually lead to a simple approach to recognizing 
	patterns in the shape of the graph, or its parts, which would produce results similar 
	to the ones of human observers.   		 
      </p>
      <p>

      <h3>The basic approach</h3>
      <p>
      </p>
      <h3>Notes on implementation</h3>
      <p>
      </p>
      <h3>Results</h3>
      <p>
        The first application of the developed Haar tree representation is to the estimation of the 
	vector of cointegration relations for a set of time series. For simplicity, I assume there is
	only one cointegration relation for now. The idea is straightforward:
	construct the Haar tree for each of the series, make vectors out of the coefficients at the
	same positions in the trees (a vector of roots, a vector of leftmost children of roots, etc.),
	consider the <em> directions</em> of these vectors to be noisy estimates of the <em>direction</em>
	of the cointegration realtions vector. Averaging the vectors in a sensible way produces an 
	estimate of the cointegration relations.
