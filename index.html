    <div class="description">
      An experimental project to explore the use of tree-based representation of 
      Haar wavelet coefficients for a time series.
    </div>

    <h2>Project description</h2>
      <h3>Motivation</h3>
      <p>
	I have had the idea of using a structured numerical representation of a two-dimensional 
	graph of a function, such as a time series, for some time now. When I decided to 
	try out OCaml, this project looked like the right testing ground. Naturally, the code is 
	amaturish, but the project gave me a chance to explore several language features in a fairly 
	realistic setting, so I think it was quite useful overall.
      </p>
      <p>
	When computing the 
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haar_wavelet"> Haar wavelet</a> 
	coeffficients, one essentially runs a recursive procedure,
	where each step consists of computing the differences between the average values of a
	function on the left and the right halfs of an interval for a set of intevals, storing 
	the results, and bisecting the original intervals before passing them as input to a 
	recursive call. So, fundamentally, the Haar wavelet coefficients are not just a set of numbers,
	but could be seen as the values at the nodes of a binary tree. While not terribly useful 
	by itself, this observation suggests a representation of the graph of the function which
	has enough structure to allow for a quick assesment of the overall shape, perhaps similar 
	to the one a reasonably educated human being would make upon being shown a graph of a function.
	This tree immediately shows if the function has a general trend, how volatile it is on a variety of scales, 
	what is the overall dynamics as the argument varies from left to right along the x-axis, etc. 
	Even more importanly, it might eventually lead to a simple approach to recognizing 
	patterns in the shape of the graph, or its parts, which would produce results similar 
	to the ones of human observers.

      <h3>The basic approach</h3>
      <p>
      </p>
      <h3>Notes on implementation</h3>
      <p>
      </p>
      <h3>Results</h3>
      <p>
        For the first attempt at using the developed Haar tree representation I have chosen the problem 
	of estimating cointegration relations between a set of time series. My suggested solution is based
	on a simple idea: the vectors whose components are the Haar wavelet 
	coefficients of each of the time series over the same time subintervals are considered to be 
	noisy samples of the true coinegration realion. (For simplisity I assume there is only one 
	relation for now.) After taking care of scaling, (which is not entirely straightforward) one 
	takes averages of vectors corresponding to the like levels of the Haar trees to get an 
	estimate of the vector of cointegration realtions.
